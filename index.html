At the<font face="Comic sans MS" color="red"><b> E-Shan Public School</b></font>, our unvarying endeavour is to accomplish the dream of our executive director,<font face="Comic sans MS" color="red"><b> Mr. Ashok Kumar Shrivastav</b></font> to build excellence in all our activities. In a short span of time the school has attained great heights in all facets of school activities. Up here in the E-Shan Public School, we are striving hard to achieve excellence in education, sports, dramatics and debates. The process of building excellence involves creating a learning institution, one of which facilitates learning of all its member and continually transforming itself.

There has been unremitting drive with commitment and zeal in our teachers to improve the multifaceted personality of our students. The teaching community has developed innovative tools and techniques to improve classroom teaching. The school has introduced interactive sessions of teachers with students and parents.

The school’s march towards success is the result of teacher’s commitment to develop a change and culture in the college. To meet the global educational requirements in education, the teachers have brought about significiant changes in the teaching methodology with the support of the managing committee, the school is being transformed into a knowledge hub. The school is constantly upgrading its computer lab, IT lab and hobby center. The stress in the school is to inculate scientific culture, human values and translate the vision of our executive director into reality.

I wish you all the very best.
